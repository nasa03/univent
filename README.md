# univent
Univent is like UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent, but better.

It uses no runtime reflection, and has no runtime allocations.

It allows any combination of primitive types and Unity objects as function parameters.

To use in your project, clone it as a submodule somewhere in your Assets folder.

```git subtree add --prefix {YOUR FOLDER} https://github.com/simonwittber/univent master```
